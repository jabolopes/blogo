To create comic blogs see [comico](http://github.com/jabolopes/comico).

## Usage

1. Download and install the [Go toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/install) (if not
   already installed).

2. Download blogo either by cloning this repository or by downloading the files
   from GitHub.

3. Add post to the `posts/` directory. See existing examples in that directory.

4. Run `make` to generate your blog. All the blogs files (that you'd need to
   deploy to a Web server) are written to the `out/dist/` directory.

That's all!

If you'd like to launch a Web server to test your blog, do the following
(requires Python3 installed):

5. Run `make run` and in your browser visit `http://localhost:8000`.
